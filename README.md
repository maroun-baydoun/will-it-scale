# Will it scale?

My submission to GitHub's [Game off 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) game jam using the Godot engine.

Your goal is to keep the website running and help it scale. To achieve that, you can buy servers whenever you have enough funds. Fail to do so, and the website's users will grow frustrated. Once their frustration level reaches the maximum, it's game over!


Download the game on my [itch.io](https://maroun-baydoun.itch.io/will-it-scale) page.
